# OpenTelemetry

## Description

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/) (otel) is an open source observability framework and toolset designed to ease the integration of observability backends such as Jaeger, Prometheus, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch and more. While it offers vendor/tool-agnostic and autoinstrumentation capabilities, the backend (storage) and the frontend (visualization) of telemetry data are intentionally left to other tools.

The plugin developed is an exporter (push) which can be connected to the otel framework via a receiver.

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured via the alumet's config.toml file with the following options:

```toml
[plugins.opentelemetry]
collector_host = "http://localhost:4317"
prefix = ""
suffix = "_alumet"
append_unit_to_metric_name = true
use_unit_display_name = true
add_attributes_to_labels = true
```

## Examples

The plugin has been tested on both, local environment using docker-compose.yaml and a K8s.

### OpenSearch local example

[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/getting-started/intro/) is a distributed search and analytics engine that can be used as vector database, full-text search and observability backend for logs, metrics and traces.

The connection to OpenSearch was done following the [official Data Prepper tutorial](https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/tree/main/examples/metrics-ingestion-otel) which is a recommended ingestion pipeline tool which can be connected to otel as recomended [here](https://opensearch.org/blog/distributed-tracing-pipeline-with-opentelemetry/).

Notes:
- For clarity, I disconnected traces and metrics from other sources to better visualize in OpenSearch what comes from alumet.
- Also, the "logging" exporter is deprecated and needs to be updated.

```yaml
# data-prepper/examples/metrics-ingestion-otel/otel-collector-config.yml
receivers:
  # hostmetrics:
  #   collection_interval: 60s
  #   scrapers:
  #     cpu:
  #     memory:
  # prometheus:
  #   config:
  #     scrape_configs:
  #       - job_name: data-prepper
  #         metrics_path: /metrics/sys
  #         scrape_interval: 60s
  #         static_configs:
  #           - targets: ['data-prepper:4900']
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317

exporters:
  debug: # Appears as "logging" but is deprecated
    verbosity: detailed
```

Alumet was left with the default configuration and resulted in the correct population of the OpenSearch database and ability to explore the data via the dashboards as shown in the figure below.

### Thanos K8s example

[Thanos](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos) is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available metric system with unlimited storage capacity, which can be added seamlessly on top of existing Prometheus deployments. Thanos Receive has the Prometheus Remote Write API built in, on top of the functionality for long-term-storage and downsampling, and it can be used directly without an underlaying Prometheus since the otel Exporter can directly upload TSDB blocks to the object storage bucket of Thanos.

Alumet was configured as following and deployed in the host of a single-node K8s cluster which had an otel collector [using the operator](https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts) and Thanos.

```toml
# Alumet config
[plugins.opentelemetry]
collector_host = "http://my-otel-collector-ingress"
prefix = ""
suffix = "_alumet"
append_unit_to_metric_name = true
use_unit_display_name = true
add_attributes_to_labels = true
```

```yaml
# Otel values.yaml
# Top level field related to the OpenTelemetry Operator
opentelemetry-operator:
  # Field indicating whether the operator is enabled or not
  enabled: true
  manager:
    collectorImage:
      repository: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
  # Sub-field for admission webhooks configuration
  admissionWebhooks:

        prometheusremotewrite:
          endpoint: "http://monitoring-hub-thanos-receive.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:19291/api/v1/receive"

          metrics:
            receivers:
              - otlp
            processors:

            exporters: 
              - prometheusremotewrite
```

### Others

- ElasticSearch natively supports the OpenTelemetry protocol and can be integrated to an otel collector via the APM, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/apm-open-telemetry.html) for an example.
